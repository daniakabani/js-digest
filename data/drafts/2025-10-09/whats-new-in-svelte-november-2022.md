It‚Äôs been a busy October for the Svelte community. use:enhance and Advanced Routes got some great improvements in SvelteKit while the Svelte compiler released a minor version to improve the day-to-day dev experience.
There‚Äôs also a huge showcase to cover... so let‚Äôs jump in!
What‚Äôs new in SvelteKit

The new update method for use:enhance lets you easily get back the default form behavior while augmenting it with your own logic (docs, #7083 and #7326)
[[optional]] parameters are now available for routing (docs, #7051)
goto now has invalidateAll to (re-)run all load functions belonging to the new active page (docs, #7407)
config.kit.paths.base is now used in adapters looking for static assets - fixing 404 issues across adapter-netlify, adapter-vercel, adapter-cloudflare, and adapter-cloudflare-workers (#4448)
Breaking changes:

Errors will now be thrown when routes conflict (#7051)
The global fetch override has been removed when prerendering (#7318)
Route IDs have been prefixed with / (#7338)
Svelte changes

New accessibility warnings, a11y-click-events-have-key-events and a11y-no-noninteractive-tabindex, will now warn when your components lack required key events or tabindex. While a11y-role-has-required-aria-props will no longer warn when elements match their semantic role (3.51.0)
--style-props are now supported on <svelte:component> and <svg> (3.51.0, Component Example: Before and After, SVG Example: Before and After)
‚Äúnullish‚Äù values for component event handlers are now supported (3.51.0, Example)
Scoped styles can now be applied to <svelte:element> (3.51.0, Example)
You can now use important in inline style tags: style:foo|important (3.52.0, #7365)
A warning will now be thrown when using <a target="_blank"> without rel="noreferrer" (3.52.0, #6188)
